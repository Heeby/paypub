What doesn't kill you, makes you stronger. The early attempts at shutting down
centralised file sharing services ended up spawning stronger technology. Like a
hydra, those of us in the community that push for individual empowerment are in
an arms race to equip the people with the tools needed for the next generation
of digital black markets.

Today we will show you the next generation of such software: opensource,
uncensored and private. The next generation of resilient uncensored markets. The
social implications of this breakthrough raise bigger questions about the role
of technology, and efforts under way to carve out spaces of the future where we
can survive, and thrive as freedom loving people.

Technology is power, and a new front has opened in the struggle for freedom.
These tools are for resource management, digital governance and new finance.
Technology is not, and never will be neutral. Software is art.
